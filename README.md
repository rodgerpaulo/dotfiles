# My simple dotfiles

## Bash

I use a simple Bash configuration, if you like a pure but pretty Terminal, here you go!

## VIM

In a nutshell, I use VIM 8, with vim-plug for managing plugins and with some custom configs for myself.

For Linux I did an optional automatic installation inside `./installation/linux.sh` script. I hope you enjoy it. :)

All VIM plugins are supported by most Linux Operational Systems and MacOS.

## Installation
Make sure you are in the project root then run

### linux-gnu installation
```
$ sh installation/linux.sh
```

### Mac installation
```
$ sh installation/mac.sh
```
